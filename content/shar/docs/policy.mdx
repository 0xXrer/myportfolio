# Policy

## fs_read / fs_write

`fs_read` and `fs_write` are allowlists of root paths. Only those roots are preopened for the module. Everything else is denied by default.

## env

`env` is a whitelist of allowed environment variable keys. Any key not listed is denied.

## net_outbound

`net_outbound` is a boolean gate. When `false`, all network access is denied. When `true`, outbound networking is allowed.

:::callout Not implemented yet
Network allowlists are not implemented yet. The only control is the boolean flag.

## limits

`limits` configures optional execution limits.

Supported fields:

- `fuel`
- `wall_time`
- `max_output_bytes`
- `memory`

When a configured limit is enforced and hit, SHAR emits `limit_hit`. If a limit is configured but not enforced, SHAR emits `limit_unenforced`.
