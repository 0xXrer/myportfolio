# Audit

SHAR writes an append-only JSONL audit log.

## Events

- `start`
- `stdout`
- `stderr`
- `policy_denied`
- `exit`

Every event includes the `run_hash`.

## run_hash

`run_hash = sha256(wasm bytes + policy manifest + SHAR version)`

## Determinism

- Event emission order is stable and append-only.
- JSON key order is stable due to typed struct serialization.
